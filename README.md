# Solidity Transfer Function Bug: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Solidity transfer functions: the lack of proper error handling.  The `transfer` function subtracts the amount from the sender's balance but does not check for errors before adding it to the receiver's balance. This can lead to loss of funds if the transfer fails due to an issue such as insufficient allowance, gas issues, or reentrancy.

## Bug Description
The `bug.sol` file contains a Solidity contract with a flawed `transfer` function.  It fails to handle potential errors during the transfer process.  This means that if the transfer is unsuccessful for any reason, the sender's balance is still decreased, resulting in a loss of funds. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.sol` file provides a corrected version of the `transfer` function, which properly handles potential errors and ensures that funds are only transferred if the operation is successful.
